#' Extract largest object from a greyscale image
#'
#' Extract the largest object from the image background.
#'
#' Threshold the input image, detect connected particles, and keep only the largest one. Note that, for ease of use, when the image has an obviously white/light background (based on [img_guess_background()]), the image is automatically inverted. Indeed, thresholding select pixels whose value is *above* the threshold = it supposes that the object of interest has values higher (i.e. lighter) than the background, which is therefore supposed to be dark.
#'
#' @inheritParams img_make_transparent
#' @param threshold grey value threshold to detect the object over the background. Either a number in `[0,1]` where `0` is pure black and `1` is pure white, or a string with a grey level quantile value (e.g. "50%" to keep 50% of the greys in the foreground).
#' @param quiet when TRUE, do not display the message about image inversion when providing an image on a light background.
#'
#' @return The extracted object, on a pure white background, as a [imager::cimg()] object.
